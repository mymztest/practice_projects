## Machine Learning Project: Heart Failure Readmission Prediction

The goal is to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict whether a patient with heart failure will be readmitted to the hospital within a certain time frame. perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Evaluation.
